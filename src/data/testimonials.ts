I feel a lot more confident using the app to see how I should play a certain shot when I'm unsure on what to do. We will definitely use this at the very least in places 18 birdies and things like that won't load for us.",

Thanks to this app, I am able to get a better idea of how likely the bet is to hit in reality.
