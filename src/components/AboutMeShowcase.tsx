          After being offered the opportunity to play golf and continue my education at{" "}
          <strong>Franklin College</strong>, I decided to take both my education and my game to the
          next level. I realized the quickest way to achieve rapid improvement was to conduct{" "}
          <strong>thorough analysis</strong> of my performance‚Äîidentifying where I could cut strokes
          and lower my scoring average.

          What many saw as a suffocating amount of research became my <strong>greatest strength</strong>,
          both on the course and in my personal development. When health challenges arrived, I faced
          a hard choice: protect my body‚Äôs long-term health or pursue a career in golf. That turning
          point led me to redirect my academic path‚Äîtransferring to <strong>Ball State University</strong> to

          At <strong>Ball State University</strong>, I gathered an enormous amount of data from many
          sources‚Äîeducational material through assignments and lectures, professional insights from
          career fairs, and collaboration with peers that sharpened communication, teamwork, and
          leadership.

        <p>
          Every experience became a <strong>data entry in my personal library of datasets</strong>:
          subjects, courses, and topics forming unique entries in a growing knowledge repository.
          I learned to write my own ‚Äúqueries‚Äù across disciplines‚Äîconnecting concepts and building an
          analytical framework I still use today.

          I pushed beyond the classroom by pursuing certifications in{" "}

          In 2023, I underwent a <strong>double foot operation</strong> that changed my life. The
          procedure resulted in a <strong>50% reduction of mobility across 8 of my 10 toes</strong>‚Äîa
          tradeoff to prevent paralysis. During recovery, academics became my anchor.
