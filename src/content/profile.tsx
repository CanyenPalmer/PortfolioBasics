              After being offered the opportunity to play golf and continue my academic studies at{" "}
              <strong>Franklin College</strong>, I dedicated myself to finding measurable edges
              through analytics‚Äîrefining techniques, improving consistency, and identifying where I
              could cut strokes and lower my scoring average.
            </p>
            <p>
              What many saw as a suffocating amount of research became my greatest strength, both on
              the course and in my personal development. When health challenges arrived, I faced a
              hard choice: protect my body‚Äôs long-term health or pursue a career in golf. That
              turning point led me to redirect my academic path‚Äîtransferring to{" "}
              <strong>Ball State University</strong> to study <strong>mathematics</strong> and{" "}

              At <strong>Ball State University</strong>, I gathered an enormous amount of data from
              many sources‚Äîeducational material through assignments and lectures, professional
              insights from career fairs, and collaboration with peers that sharpened communication,
              teamwork, and leadership.

              Every experience became a{" "}
              <strong>data entry in my personal library of datasets</strong>: subjects, courses, and
              topics forming unique entries in a growing knowledge repository. I learned to write my
              own ‚Äúqueries‚Äù across disciplines‚Äîconnecting concepts and building an analytical
              framework I still use today.
            </p>
            <p>
              I pushed beyond the classroom by pursuing certifications in data analysis and data
              science, building real projects, and continuously expanding the scope and depth of that
              knowledge base.

              In <strong>2023</strong>, I underwent a double foot operation that changed my
              life‚Äîsurgery was required to relieve nerve stress and prevent paralysis. During
              recovery, academics became my anchor.
            </p>
            <p>
              That summer, I earned placement on the <strong>Dean‚Äôs List</strong> at Ball State
              while continuing to build projects, resum√© materials, and my personal brand‚Äî all while
              learning to walk again.

              I once thought the hardest part would be landing a fair-paying job. Instead, the
              hardest part was putting on my socks after surgery‚Äîand choosing to keep moving

              After graduation, I explored what the world could offer me‚Äîand what I could offer
              myself. I gained real-world experience at an overnight manufacturing facility and a{" "}
              <strong>DME</strong> startup, while continuing freelance analytics for companies,
              peers, and family. That‚Äôs where I learned what it truly means to put passion into

              Today, I‚Äôm pursuing my <strong>Master‚Äôs in Data Science</strong> at the{" "}

              harness data science, machine learning, analytics, and software development to make
              life better for all.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am currently <strong>open to work</strong> and want to collaborate with companies
              who share this vision. If your mission is to build solutions that improve people‚Äôs
