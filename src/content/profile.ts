              After being offered the opportunity to play golf and continue my education at{" "}
              <strong>Franklin College</strong>, I decided to take both my education and my game to
              the next level. I realized the quickest way to achieve rapid improvement was to
              conduct <strong>thorough analysis</strong> of my performance‚Äîidentifying where I could
              cut strokes and lower my scoring average.
            </p>
            <p>
              What many saw as a suffocating amount of research became my{" "}
              <strong>greatest strength</strong>, both on the course and in my personal development.
              When health challenges arrived, I faced a hard choice: protect my body‚Äôs long-term
              health or pursue a career in golf. That turning point led me to redirect my academic
              path‚Äîtransferring to <strong>Ball State University</strong> to study{" "}
              <strong>mathematics</strong> and <strong>computer science</strong>.

              At <strong>Ball State University</strong>, I gathered an enormous amount of data from
              many sources‚Äîeducational material through assignments and lectures, professional
              insights from career fairs, and collaboration with peers that sharpened communication,
              teamwork, and leadership.

              Every experience became a{" "}
              <strong>data entry in my personal library of datasets</strong>: subjects, courses, and
              topics forming unique entries in a growing knowledge repository. I learned to write my
